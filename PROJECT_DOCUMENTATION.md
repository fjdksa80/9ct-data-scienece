### Hypothesis

**Artificial intelligence is eliminationg more jobs than it is creating.**

### Requirements Outline

**Functional Requirements**

- I need to be able to load my .csv file with my dataset.

- I need to be able to sort through my dataset to view specific relevant data points.

- I need to be able to create relevant and insightful charts with my data using matplotlib.

- The program will need to output a visualisation of the data or a filtered version of the dataset. My datat will need to be stored in a .csv file 

**Non-Functional Requirements**

- The user interface should be simple and easy to understand and use.

Reliability: What is required from the system when providing information to the user on errors and ensuring data integrity?
